# Introduction

This project is primarily about experimenting with bulding different kinds of agents.

## Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)

The Google Agent Development Kit (ADK) is a comprehensive toolkit designed to streamline the creation, evaluation, and deployment of AI agents. It offers a flexible and modular framework that supports developers in building sophisticated agents capable of interacting with various tools and APIs. The ADK is optimized for the Google ecosystem but remains model-agnostic, allowing for integration with a wide range of language models.
The official documentation for the ADK can be found here:

### ADK Sample Code

A collection of sample agents built with the ADK is available on GitHub. This repository provides examples for both Python and Java.

### ADK for Python

For Python developers, the `adk-python` library provides a code-first toolkit for building, evaluating, and deploying AI agents. It is a flexible and modular framework that is optimized for the Google ecosystem but is designed to be model-agnostic.

## Grounding with Google Maps in Vertex AI

To enhance generative AI applications with real-world, up-to-date information, you can use grounding with Google Maps data in Vertex AI. This feature helps to reduce hallucinations and improve the accuracy of AI-powered responses by connecting models to Google Maps' vast repository of geospatial data.
