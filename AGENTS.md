# Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)

This project is primarily about building agents using the Google Agent Development Kit (ADK).

## Documentation

The official documentation for the ADK can be found here:

[https://google.github.io/adk-docs/](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/)

## Sample Code

A collection of sample agents built with the ADK is available on GitHub. This repository provides examples for both Python and Java.

## ADK for Python

For Python developers, the `adk-python` library provides a code-first toolkit for building, evaluating, and deploying AI agents. It is a flexible and modular framework that is optimized for the Google ecosystem but is designed to be model-agnostic.

## Grounding with Google Maps in Vertex AI

To enhance generative AI applications with real-world, up-to-date information, you can use grounding with Google Maps data in Vertex AI. This feature helps to reduce hallucinations and improve the accuracy of AI-powered responses by connecting models to Google Maps' vast repository of geospatial data.
